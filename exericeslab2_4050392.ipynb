              "\"The word pollution was derived from the Latin word pollution, which means to make dirty. Pollution is the process of making the environment pollute the water and the air by adding harmful substances. Pollution causes an imbalance in the environment. This imbalance threatened the very survival of all forms of life. It's a threat to the whole world. India ranks at the bottom of 125 of the 132 countries in the 2012 Environmental Performance Index. This report is produced by researchers at Yale and Columbia University in association with the World Economic Forum.\\n\\n2.Pollution of the environment is a serious problem of industrialized societies. Industrial development and the green revolution have had a negative impact on the environment. People have converted the life support system of all living people into their own resources and have greatly disrupted the natural ecological balance. Serious degradation and depletion have been caused due to overuse, abuse and mismanagement of resources to meet human greed.\\nEnvironmental pollution is defined as the adverse alteration of our environment. It is a by-product of human activities that are directly or indirectly responsible for the changes in the environment. These changes could be in the physical, chemical or biological characteristics of air or water that are harmful to human life and other living things. Population explosion, rapid industrialization, deforestation, unplanned urbanization, scientific and technological advancement, etc. The main causes of environmental pollution. About 35% of India's total area is seriously polluted. Three-quarters of the land is water, but there is a shortage of drinking water. In India, water sources are found in ponds and river lakes have been polluted and are unfit for consumption. Due to the increased use of fertilizers, seas and oceans have been contaminated with harmful pollutants.\\n\""

Population explosion, rapid industrialization, deforestation, unplanned urbanization, scientific and technological advancement, etc. The main causes of environmental pollution. About 35% of India's total area is seriously polluted. Three-quarters of the land is water, but there is a shortage of drinking water.
